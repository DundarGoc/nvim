--- Work with indent scope.
---
--- # Setup~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.indentscope').setup({})`
--- (replace `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table
--- `MiniIndentscope` which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua
--- MiniIndentscope.*`). See |MiniIndentscope.config| for available config
--- settings.
---
--- # Disabling~
---
--- To disable, set `g:miniindentscope_disable` (globally) or
--- `b:miniindentscope_disable` (for a buffer) to `v:true`.
---@tag MiniIndentscope mini.indentscope

--- Drawing of scope indicator
---
--- Draw of scope indicator is done as iterative animation. It has the
--- following design:
--- - Draw indicator on origin line (where cursor is at) immediately. Indicator
---   is visualized as `MiniIndentscope.config.symbol` placed to the right of
---   scope's outer indent. This creates a line from top to bottom scope edges.
--- - Draw upward and downward concurrently per one line. Progression by one
---   line in both direction is considered to be one step of animation.
--- - Before each step wait certain amount of time, which is decided by
---   "animation function". It takes next and total step numbers (both are one
---   or bigger) and return number of milliseconds to wait before drawing next
---   step. Comparing to a more popular "easing functions" in animation (input:
---   duration since animation start; output: percent of animation done), it is
---   a discrete inverse version of its derivative. Such interface proved to be
---   more appropriate for kind of task at hand.
---
--- Special cases~
---
--- - When scope to be drawn intersects (same indent, ranges overlap) currently
---   visible one (at process or finished drawing), drawing is done immediately
---   without animation. With most common example being typing new text, this
---   feels more natural.
--- - Scope for the whole is not drawn as it is isually redundant. Technically,
---   it can be thought as drawn at column 0 (because outer indent is -1) which
---   is not visible.
---@tag MiniIndentscope-drawing

---@alias __animation_duration number Total duration (in ms) of any animation. Default: 100.
---@alias __animation_type string Type of progression. One of:
---   - 'in': accelerating from zero speed.
---   - 'out': decelerating to zero speed.
---   - 'in-out': accelerating until halfway, then decelerating.
---@alias __animation_function function Animation function (see |MiniIndentscope-drawing|).

-- Notes about implementation:
-- - Scope - maximum set of consecutive lines which contains input line and
--   every member has indent not less than input "indent at column".
--   Technically: <buffer id> + <indents: outer (where visual line will be
--   drawn) and inner (which is used to compute range)> + <range of lines>.
-- - Tried and rejected features/optimizations:
--     - Gap at cursor. Intended to always show cursor at normal state. It
--       might be more visually pleasing and more convenient when start typing
--       over indicator. Couldn't properly do that because couldn't find an
--       appropriate (fast, non-blocking, without much code complexity,
--       low-flickering) way to do that. There was an idea of making draw
--       function not draw at cursor and update only cursor gap when it was
--       enough, but there was slight flickering and too much code complexity.
--     - Draw only inside current window view (from top visible line to bottom
--       one). Would decrease workload. Couldn't properly do that because there
--       is early screen redraw after `WinScrolled` which introduced flickering
--       when scrolling (so it was `WinScrolled` -> redraw with current
--       extmarks -> redraw with new extmarks).
-- - Manual tests to check proper behavior (not sure how to autotest this):
--     - Moving cursor faster than debounce delay should not initiate drawing.
--     - Extmark on cursor line should show right after debounce delay. Other
--       steps (if present) should use animation function.
--     - Usual typing on new line without decreasing indent should immediately
--       update scope without animation (although it is a different scope).
--     - Moving cursor within same scope when it is already drawing shouldn't
--       stop drawing.
--     - Fast consecutive scrolling within big scope (try `<C-d>` and `<Down>`)
--       shouldn't cause flicker.

---@text
--- Notes~
--- - Indent rules are designed to compute indent based on two equally possible
---   indent values. They matter only if values are different, all of them
---   return same result otherwise. Here is an illustration of how they work
---   when empty lines are present:
--- >
---                              |max|min|previous|next|
---   1|function foo()           | 0 | 0 |   0    | 0  |
---   2|                         | 4 | 0 |   0    | 4  |
---   3|    print('Hello world') | 4 | 4 |   4    | 4  |
---   4|                         | 4 | 2 |   4    | 2  |
---   5|  end                    | 2 | 2 |   2    | 2  |
--- <
---   So, for example, a scope at line 3 and right-most column has range
---   depending on `MiniIndentscope.config.rules.blank`: 2-4 for "max", 3-3 for
---   "min", 3-4 for "previous", and 2-3 for "next".
---   Also, when using "max" as indent rule for blank lines, outer indent of
---   scope is: 2 for "max", 0 for "min", 0 for "previous", and 2 for "next".

-- Module functionality =======================================================
--- Compute indent scope
---
--- Indent scope (or just "scope") is a maximum set of consecutive lines which
--- contains input line and every member has indent not less than input "indent
--- at column". Here "indent at column" means minimum between column value and
--- indent of input line. When using cursor column, this allows for a useful
--- interactive view of nested indent scopes by making horizontal movements.
---
--- Algorithm overview~
---
--- - Compute reference "indent at column".
--- - Process upwards and downwards from input line to search for line with
---   indent (see next section) strictly less than reference one. This is like
---   casting rays up and down from input line and reference indent until
---   meeting "a wall" (non-whitespace character or buffer edge). Latest line
---   before that meeting is a respective range end of scope. It always exists
---   because input line is a such one.
--- - Based on top and bottom lines with strictly lower indent, compute scope's
---   "outer" indent. The way it is computed is decided based on
---   `MiniIndentscope.config.rules.scope` (see |MiniIndentscope.config| for
---   more information).
---
--- Indent computation~
---
--- For every line indent is intended to be computed unambiguously:
--- - For "normal" lines indent is an output of |indent()|.
--- - Indent is `-1` for imaginary lines 0 and past last line.
--- - For blank and empty lines indent is computed based on previous
---   (|prevnonblank()|) and next (|nextnonblank()|) non-blank lines. The way
---   it is computed is decided based on `MiniIndentscope.config.rules.blank`
---   (see |MiniIndentscope.config| for more information).
---
---@param line number Line number (starts from 1). Default: cursor line.
---@param col number Column number (starts from 1). Default: cursor column from
---   `curswant` of |getcurpos()|. This allows for more natural behavior on
---   empty lines.
---
---@return table Table with scope information:
---   - <buf_id> - identifier of current buffer.
---   - <indent> - table with <inner> (indent for computing scope) and <outer>
---     (computed indent of outer lines) keys.
---   - <range> - table with <top> (top line of scope, inclusive) and <bottom>
---     (bottom line of scope, inclusive) keys. Line numbers start at 1.

-- Animations =================================================================
--- Imitate common power easing function
---
--- Every step is preceeded by waiting time decreasing/increasing in power
--- series fashion (`d` is 'delta', ensures total duration time):
--- - 'in':  d*n^p; d*(n-1)^p; ... ; d*2^p;     d*1^p
--- - 'out': d*1^p; d*2^p;     ... ; d*(n-1)^p; d*n^p
--- - 'in-out': 'in' until 0.5*n, 'out' afterwards
---
--- This way it imitates `power + 1` common easing function because animation
--- progression behaves as sum of `power` elements.
---
---@param power number Power of series.
---@param make_delta function Function which computes common delta so that
---   overall duration will have desired value.
---@param type __animation_type
